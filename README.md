### Windy

Wanted to quickly see if the wind direction in Ann Arbor is, indeed, primarily
from the West... The histogram binary reads historic weather data and creates
polar histograms of wind direction.

This utility requires that Python3 versions of numpy/pandas/matplotlib are
installed. To run:

```
$ ./histogram.py --csv data.csv
```
